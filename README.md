# ​​​ Orifha Joan — Security Analyst | Networking Engineer | Ethical Hacking Explorer

I’m a **Security Analyst** and **Networking Engineer** with over a year of hands-on experience across operating systems, data centers, and threat simulations. I like to think of myself as a **Reconnaissance Woman**—curious, detail-focused, and always probing beneath the surface.
